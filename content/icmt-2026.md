The Intercollegiate Math Tournament is pleased to announce its inaugural event
at Columbia University.

ICMT is the first in-person team-based mathematics competition for undergraduate
students from universities worldwide. The tournament is organized by graduate
students and alumni from prestigious mathematics competitions including BMT (UC
Berkeley), SMT (Stanford), HMMT (Harvard & MIT), PUMaC (Princeton), and CMIMC
(CMU).

Detailed information regarding the schedule, room assignments, and event
logistics will be released closer to the competition date.

## Student Eligibility

To participate in ICMT, you must:

- Be actively enrolled as an undergraduate student at an accredited college or
  university
- Not have received a bachelor's degree or international equivalent
- Have participated in ICMT fewer than four times

Students from both domestic and international universities are welcome.
Mathematics majors or formal mathematics coursework are not required—only a
passion for mathematics.

Questions regarding eligibility should be directed to
<team@intercollegiatemathtournament.org>.

## Teams

Teams consist of four students. Teammates may be from different universities but
must compete in the same division:

- **Division A** (for experienced competitors): In addition to the Division B
  syllabus, topics include linear algebra, abstract algebra, real and complex
  analysis, as well as other undergraduate subjects.
- **Division B** (for newer competitors): Topics include high school math
  competition subjects (AMC 10/12 level), as well as single- and multi-variable
  calculus, differential equations, and basic linear algebra.

Sample problems are available to help determine the appropriate division:

- [Division A sample problems](/assets/sample-problems-a.pdf)
- [Division B sample problems](/assets/sample-problems-b.pdf)

ICMT reserves the right to merge incomplete teams to form complete four-person
teams.

## How to Register

Registration, team assignments, waiver signing, and score reports are managed
through ContestDojo, our online competition platform.

Questions about the ContestDojo portal should be directed to
<team@intercollegiatemathtournament.org>.

## Travel and Accommodations

Teams are responsible for arranging their own travel and lodging. Columbia
University has secured discounted rates at a few
[local hotels](https://visit.columbia.edu/content/accommodations-0).

### Lodging Options

Due to heavy regulation of short-term rentals in New York City, Airbnb options
are limited. For more affordable accommodations, we recommend:

- Hotels in New Jersey along the
  [Northeast Corridor NJ Transit line](https://www.njtransit.com/abc_northeast_corridor)
- Hotels in Jersey City or Hoboken along the
  [PATH line](https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/schedules-maps.html)

Please note that check-in begins at 8:00 AM at Columbia University.

### Transportation

We strongly recommend using public transportation. For those who choose to
drive, these are the [parking decks](https://visit.columbia.edu/content/parking)
recommended by the Columbia Visitor Center.

Columbia University is accessible from all three major New York City airports
(JFK, LGA, EWR) via NJ Transit or subway. From Penn Station, Moynihan Station,
or Port Authority Bus Terminal, take the Uptown 1 train to 116th Street.

## Financial Aid

ICMT has limited financial aid funding available exclusively for students
demonstrating significant financial need (e.g., Pell Grant recipients or
students with equivalent documentation). Financial aid recipients may receive:

- Reimbursement for one night of lodging (Friday)
- Registration fee waiver (awarded following the competition)

We strongly encourage teams to pursue departmental or institutional funding from
their universities for travel and lodging expenses. ICMT financial aid is
awarded on a highly selective, case-by-case basis and may only provide partial
assistance.

Financial aid applications will be available on ContestDojo. Applicants will
have one week to confirm acceptance or request a registration fee refund.

## Contest Format

ICMT consists of three rounds:

  answer a series of questions centered around a specific topic, culminating in
  significant results in that field.

- **Individual Round**: Contestants complete a series of short-answer questions
  covering a broad range of mathematical topics within their division.

- **Constellation Round** (team-based): A fast-paced round with real-time
  submission and a live scoreboard, testing not only mathematical knowledge but
  also strategic planning and quick thinking.

Detailed information regarding timing, scoring, tiebreakers, and number of
questions will be announced at a later date.

All answers must be submitted according to the
[acceptable answer formats document](/answer-formats.pdf).
Answers not submitted in the specified formats will be marked incorrect, even if
mathematically equivalent.

## Activities

Hudson River Trading (HRT), our premier sponsor, will host an activity following
lunch.

Optional Friday evening activities will include an Integration Bee and social
events hosted by our sponsors. Additional details will be released closer to the
competition date.
